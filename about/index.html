            <p>
            Kaushik Das was born on 15th March, 1998 at Bally, North 24 Parganas, West Bengal, India. When he was 6 months old he had got a bit of idea about Music, because Soft Music was   played in his house. From that time Music has been a companion of Kaushik. When he was 1.5 years old he understood Pure Indian Music, i.e. Rabindra Sangeet, Classical Music and  Bollywood.
            </p>
            <center><img src="images/biopic/1.jpg" style="height:35vh"></center>
            <p> 
            When Kaushik was 2 years old he was admitted to the Holy Cross todler's school at Ranchi for the first time. When he was 3 years old, he was given a microphone to sing, and then he tried his best to sing.  Everyone liked his voice a lot. Then he used to perform regularly in any event taking place in his school(St. Thomas School,Ranchi). His class teacher suggested his mom to get him admitted somewhere for regular Music classes. When he was in first standard, i.e. 6 years old, he had to leave Ranchi and come back to Kolkata.
            </p>
            <p> 
            After taking admission in The Aryans School at Kolkata, Kaushik didn’t get the direct chance to perform in any function.  But after a long request to his music teacher he got a chance  to sing in a group song when he was in his second standard, i.e. 7 years old and from then onwards he used to sing in each and every event taking place in his school. When he   was in third standard, i.e. 8 years old, his parents got him admitted to a private Music teacher for regular Music classes in Indian Classical Music. 
            </p>
            <center><img src="images/biopic/6.jpg" style="height:35vh"></center>
            <p> 
            Then when he was in fourth standard, i.e. 9 years old he became a member of the School Choir Group. Every day on the morning he used to sing the Morning Prayer and the National  Anthem along with few other boys in his school. He also had to continue his studies in the same flow in order to score good results. He became very popular in his school  because of his regular participation for singing in any event. He also had the desire to participate in a competition, but there were few musicians in his school who could sing   better than him, so he didn’t get a chance to participate. However, still he tried his best to get participation in a music competition. When he was in seventh standard, i.e.  13 years old he had to leave his regular music classes due to some family problem. 
            </p>
            <p> 
            Then he heard a Hip-Hop song, which he liked a lot. He wanted to know more about Hip-Hop genre. Then for many days he became one of the biggest fans of Hip-Hop music. During   these days he got a bit of interest in DJ-ing, and these days he used to play with different DJ softwares and different Sound Mixing softwares. Then when he was in tenth   standard, i.e. 15 years old, he finally got a chance to participate in a competition, where he stood first. Then 3 months before his tenth standard board examinations, he sung   for the last time in that school. Before getting up on the stage, tears rolled down his eyes because he had studied in that school for 9 years and had performed a lot of times.  Then after his tenth standard board examination, he left that school.
            </p>
            <center><img src="images/biopic/4.jpg" style="height:35vh"></center>
            <p> 
            When Kaushik was of 16 years old, after a lot of request, his parents hot him enrolled in a ‘Pro DJ-ing’ course of 3 months, to Dj Aleex. For few days he kept his stage  name as DJ DASH Kaushik and made his genre as House because he loved Hardwell a lot. Then he took admission to a new school(Sudhir Memorial Institute,Doltala) in eleventh standard where he had got a chance to sing  but his parents had strictly denied him to stop everything for two years, just for the huge pressure of studies. Then he changed his stage name from DJ DASH Kaushik to DJ ROOP. But  still he used to do DJ-ing in his school, ex school and few other places like marriage parties, birthday parties, etc., secretly so that his parents do not come to know. These  two years he didn’t sing, but he went for DJ-ing only in those places which he liked. Then when he was in twelfth standard, i.e. 17 years old he gave his XII standard board   examinations. He used to watch YouTube tutorials about Music Production using FL Studio, whenever he got leisure time. Because he couldn’t tell his parents to get him admitted   somewhere for a “Music Production” course.  
            </p>
            <center><img src="images/biopic/5.jpg" style="height:50vh"></center>
            <p> 
            Then after his XII standard board examinations and Joint Entrance Examinations, i.e. 18 years old, he decided to continue his studies and DJing, both in the same flow. He used   to collect information about DJing from wherever he used to get chance. He wanted to perform at different places, but as he was not in touch with music in the same flow as he  was four years ago, people didn’t call him much for his performance.
            </p>
            <p> 
            Then he joined University of Engineering and Management (UEM Kolkata) for his Graduation (B.Tech) course. Then, after watching YouTube tutorials, suggested by his best friend,Ankit, for 2 consecutive years, he  released his first Original’s, 1503 (pronounced: one five zero three) on 25th June 2016. Then for next four months he released his next few originals, example:- Nightmare, Love   is Fun, Colourful, ROOPology. But he didn’t perform anywhere since he had joined his college because from the first day of the college he was trying to buy his first set of, a   pair of CDJ consoles and a DJ Mixer. Then finally after 6 failures, at the 7th attempt he could buy his first Pioneer CDJ 350 Multi Player and NX Audio Carbon 3 channel mixer on  28th December 2016.
            </p>
            <center><img src="images/biopic/2.jpg" style="height:50vh"></center>
            <p> 
            After that he started getting contacts for Christmas Eve, NYEs, etc. For the first time he played with his Consoles and Mixer in his College during an Alumni Organisation  Festival. Then suddenly his music got selected in North East India’s biggest DJ War, CROSSFADE (Alcheringa ’17, IIT Guwahati). Then after his participation he came out as a   finalist.
            </p>
            <p> 
            Then during the year 2017, i.e. when he was 19 years of age he used to perform in different events, few college concerts too. By this time he had his name printed in posters   and flyers about his performance in any concert. He used to play in few Jam session parties in different clubs all around Kolkata. In the meantime he used to make and release  Remixes or Mashups of few Bollywood songs, few International hits, etc.In this manner 2017 passed away with a few gigs like winter parties, Christmas eve, NYE etc. In this year he also wrote many short poems of 5-6 lines. In this manner 2017 passed away with a few gigs like winter parties, Christmas eve, NYE etc. 
            </p>
            <p>
              2018 was proved to be one of the best years in ROOP's life. In the month of January he had received an official invitation from KSHITIJ, the Techno-Management Festival of Indian Institute of Technology(IIT), Kharagpur, for performing in their festival. In the month of February he had received an official invitation from ALCHERINGA, the Cultural Festival of Indian Institute of Technology(IIT), Guwahati. Then he became the Winner of North-East India's biggest DJ War, CROSSFADE. He had performed in few popular festivals all around West Bengal like Xavotsav, Espektro-KGEC, etc.
              India's No. 1 DJ Academy, PartyMap Academy had offered him courses that ROOP could take training under their guidance for free. Then after few days PartyMap Academy had offered him a JOB of being a Faculty of their Academy, but ROOP had to reject it because he wanted to complete his Graduation and then finally enter into a Full Time professional field.
